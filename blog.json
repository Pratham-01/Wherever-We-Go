    "full-content": "Chadar Trek or the Frozen River Trek is known to be one of the most difficult as well as gorgeous treks of the great Himalayan Ranges. Trekkers have to walk on the frozen Zanskar River which turns into a solid bed of ice during winters. Offering breath-taking views of the surroundings, the trek takes you through some of the most solitary locales. You may even get a chance to see some rare wildlife such as ibex or spot a local mountain goat. The trek is not a simple expedition into the mountains but a challenging adventure that will test your strength with harsh weather, sub-zero temperatures, and steep terrains.",
